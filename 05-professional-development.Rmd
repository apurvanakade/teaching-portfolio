# Professional Development

## Project NExT
Mathematical American Association's [Project
NExT](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next) (New
Experiences in Teaching) is a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in the
mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career: improving the teaching and
learning of mathematics, engaging in research and scholarship, finding exciting and interesting
service opportunities, and participating in professional activities. For me the greatest value of
this program is the opportunity it provides to connect to with and learn from other math educators
from all over the country. 

## JHU Teaching Academy Certification 
I have obtained a [teaching certification](https://ctei.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/coc) from the
[Teaching Academy at JHU](https://ctei.jhu.edu/teaching-academy). The Teaching Academy's Certificate
of Completion program is designed to help prepare Ph.D. students and Post-doctoral Fellows for
academic careers and to provide assistance in acquiring a foundation for the teaching
responsibilities associated with their first faculty appointments. This program exposed me to the
concept of teaching as scholarship and really got me interested in my current career as a math
educator.
