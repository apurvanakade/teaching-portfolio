My current understanding of learning (and teaching) is a multifaceted 

Instead of trying to define what teaching and learning is for me, I've adopted a more
improvisational view toward teaching. I see a course as a complex ecosystem consisting of students,
instructors, TAs, lectures, homework, exam, etc.
