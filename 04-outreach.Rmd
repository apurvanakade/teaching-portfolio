# Mentoring

## Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program

I am a supplemental instructor for the [Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program](https://sites.northwestern.edu/causeway/)
at Northwestern University for the 2022-23 academic year.
My duties include meeting with the participants weekly as a tutor, holding office hours, and liaising with course instructors to provide additional examples, exercises, and reviews for the students.

The Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program is a yearlong experience in mathematics that seeks to increase the number of graduate mathematical science graduates from historically underrepresented groups. Beginning in July 2021, Causeway participants will undertake a rigorous program of study in foundational coursework; work closely with Northwestern faculty on an appropriate research project, and receive career mentoring while serving as mentors for other groups themselves.

## Directed Reading Program

The Directed Reading Program pairs undergraduates with a graduate student/postdoc whose interests align with theirs and study a topic of their choice for one semester. It is intended to help motivated students explore topics more in-depth than possible in a classroom setting. Iâ€™ve helped start and organize the [DRP at UWO](https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/current_students/directed_reading_program.html). In the past, I have co-organized the [DRP at JHU](https://math.jhu.edu/drp.html).
These programs have been greatly successful at both the universities and have seen a steady increase in participants over the years.

## Topics in Category Theory

In Fall 2019, I supervised a topics course on topics in category theory for graduate students at UWO.
We covered topics from Weibel's Homological Algebra and Emily Riehl's Category Theory in Context textbooks. -->
