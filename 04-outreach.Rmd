# Mentoring 

**This website is under construction and should be up-to-date by the end of September.**

## Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program
I am a mentor for the [Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program](https://sites.northwestern.edu/causeway/)
at Northwestern University for the 2022-23 academic year.

## Northwestern Emerging Scholar's Program 
I am a co-director of the [Northwestern Emerging Scholar's
Program](https://www.math.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/prizes-competitions-organizations/northwestern-emerging-scholars.html).

## Directed Reading Program 
I've helped *start* and organize the [DRP at
UWO](https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/current_students/directed_reading_program.html) and in
the past have co-organized the [DRP at JHU](https://math.jhu.edu/drp.html). The Directed Reading
Program is a program in which undergrads are paired with a graduate student/postdoc whose interests
align with theirs and they study a topic of their choice for one semester. It is intended to help
motivated students explore topics in more depth than possible in a classroom setting.
