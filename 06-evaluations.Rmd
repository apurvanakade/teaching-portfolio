## Student Evaluations

## Peer Evaluations
  In Winter 2020, I participated in the Teaching Mentor Program at UWO.
  The Teaching Mentor Program is a cohort-based hands-on learning experience, wherein participants
  work with a group of 4-5 interdisciplinary graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to observe
  and offer feedback on one another's teaching. Groups will meet multiple times over the course of
  the semester, to act as students in one anotherâ€™s teaching demonstrations. My group had four
  participants whose feedbacks are attached at the end of this document.
