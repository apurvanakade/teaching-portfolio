# Teaching Experience 

Below is detailed information about some courses I've taught in the past. 
A short list can be found in my [CV](https://github.com/apurvnakade/PDFs/blob/main/CV.pdf).

## Northwestern University, 2021 -

### Introduction to Optimization {-}

*Role:* Instructor - Winter 2021, Spring 2021

I taught this quarter long course for two quarters in 2021. The course was aimed at upper level
undergraduates majoring in math and economics. 

- Class Notes: 
  
  I wrote detailed notes for this course which can be found here: [apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization](https://apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization/). 

- Excel Worksheets:

  I designed the course to have both a theoretical and a practical component. The lectures focused on the theory of optimization and the discussion sections on the practical applications. Students had to model and solve optimization problems during the weekly discussion sections using the [Solver tool in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-solver-add-in-in-excel-612926fc-d53b-46b4-872c-e24772f078ca). These were to be submitted at the end of the quarter and formed a significant assessment component.

### Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus (MENU) {-}

*Role:* Instructor - 2021, Coordinator - 2022

This is an year long accelerated course covering the topics of linear algebra and
multivariable calculus. I was an instructor for this course in 2021 and am currently the course 
coordinator. My primary focus as a coordinator has been to reduce student stress in this fast-paced 
course. I've reduced the amount of material covered in lectures and created meaningful discussion 
worksheets that students ... Another significant change I made was with the exams. I reduced the amount of material asked during the exam and instead focused on asking more conceptual questions.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

### Discrete Structures for Engineering {-}

*Role:* Instructor - Fall 2021

This was a semester long four-credit course offered to second-year software engineering students. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts in discrete math, such as logic, combinatorics, modular arithmetic as well as proof-writing. I am the only instructor for this course, and
my class has nearly 200 students. I had to adapt the course to fit an online mode of delivery.

 Over the summer, I had to adapt a regular Discrete Math course to an online asynchronous setting. While I was preparing for the course, my priority was to reduce student anxiety, simplify the course delivery as much as possible, and minimize the screen time for students.

- Textbook:

  I decided to abandon the traditional textbooks and chose an online one, called \href{https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020}{Zybooks}, which had interactive components and provided students with immediate feedback. The book is also extremely comprehensive and contains copious amounts of auto-graded exercises, in addition to several practice problems, which I assign weekly to help keep students on track. Finally, the book is exceptionally configurable, both in terms of content and structure.
  The textbook can be found here: \href{https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020}{learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020}


- Lectures:

  To minimize the amount of required screen-time for students, I made short videos for each topic instead of a long one for each lecture. Having a textbook that I knew would fill in the gaps left out by the short lectures was crucial for making this choice. I embed these video lectures directly within the textbook to provide a centralized resource to students, much like other online platforms such as Coursera and Kaggle.
  The video lectures are also available on YouTube at the following link: \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN}{www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN}

- Exam:

  I decided to use \href{https://webwork.maa.org/}{WeBWork} to make exam problems.
  For this, I researched a lot about online testing platforms. I chose WeBWork because it is robust and reliable, and it allows for both internal randomization within a question and randomization between questions. Having an extensive repository of questions enables me to create unique exams for every student.

- Rubric for proofs:

  This course also introduced students to proof-writing.
  This was especially challenging to teach in an online asynchronous setting as it is not possible to provide students with immediate feedback.
  To remedy this, I decided to grade students on only the \emph{writing} part of proofs.
  I designed the homework questions based on the textbook questions (for which detailed solutions were provided) and provided students with a rubric on which their writing was going to be graded.
  The rubric can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:sample-teaching-materials}.

- WeBWorK questions repository:

  With my postdoc advisor and two students' help, we designed a repository of several hundred problems for discrete math on WeBWork.
  This repository is easily portable and can be adapted to any discrete math course.
  Furthermore, because WeBWorK is open-source this repository can be used by anyone freely.


- Discussion forums:

  I realized early on that communication was going to be the key to this course's smooth running. For this reason, I choose Piazza as a discussion forum to answer student questions and encourage them to answer each otherâ€™s problems. Piazza is very intuitive, easily searchable, and allows for anonymous posts.
  A demo of the discussion forum can be found here: https://piazza.com/demo_login?nid=kd1rr8nxc6z4b5&auth=f76e59e

- Centralized access:

  With students getting overwhelmed with the onslaught of online tools, it was necessary to make easily accessible. For this, with a little bit of tweaking, I embedded all the above websites into the school's LMS.
