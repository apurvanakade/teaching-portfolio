[["index.html", "Teaching Portfolio Introduction", " Teaching Portfolio Apurva Nakade 2022-08-23 Introduction Im a postdoctoral lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Northwestern University. Before coming to Northwestern, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Western Ontario from 2019 to 2021. I obtained my PhD from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled An application of the h-principle to Manifold Calculus. My academic responsibilities have included coordinating and teaching multi-section courses managing and teaching in-person courses with several hundred students, adapting large service courses for asynchronous education, creating advanced electives and short bootcamp courses for small groups of students, creating content for OER texts, managing TAs, hiring mentors for summer camps, supervising reading courses and reading programs, formalizing mathematics in Lean theorem prover. I have taught topics spanning calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, linear programming, discrete math, proof checking using computers, manifolds, and algebraic topology. Im currently focused on finding ways of incorporating technology into my courses and making the classes more useful to students interested in applied fields. "],["teaching-statement.html", "1 Teaching Statement", " 1 Teaching Statement Teaching Philosophy I believe that the best way to learn math is through making mistakes, getting confused, and struggling toward a solution. I consider myself a coach and a facilitator and teach with the core philosophy that my primary goal is to provide my students with a welcoming and inclusive environment where experimentation is encouraged and honest mistakes arent penalized. I use active learning techniques in all my classes. I believe that a math classroom is a place for students, and even the instructor, to grow as mathematicians. My teaching experience ranges from creating advanced electives and short bootcamp courses for small groups of students, to managing and teaching in-person courses with several hundred students, coordinating multi-section classes, and adapting large service courses for asynchronous education. I have contributed to open source texts using technologies such as Webwork, Pretext, and RMarkdown and Im involved in the long-term project of math-formalization using the Lean theorem prover. I have taught topics spanning calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, discrete math, linear programming, proof checking using computers, manifolds, and algebraic topology. Use of Technology Students retain their knowledge better when they engage with a subject through multiple modalities. I find technological tools to be perfect for accomplishing this. I created weekly Excel worksheets for modeling linear programming scenarios. For Discrete Math, I used an online textbook which had (compulsory) interactive activities scattered throughout the text and made YouTube videos for each section which were embedded directly in the textbook. Student responses for these have been overwhelming positive. I strongly believe in making education more accessible by creating open educational resources (OER). We now have the technological tools to make this possible. I have co-received an OER Faculty Grant for adding WeBWorK exercises to my colleaguess Linear Algebra OER textbook written in PreTeXt. I also intend to turn my Optimization course notes into an OER textbook. I already make all my course notes available on my personal website. Diversifying Assessments Students often perform poorly on exams not because of a lack of understanding but because of exam anxiety and lack of exam-taking skills. Traditional exams do not faithfully represent the challenges students are likely to face in real life either. As such, in every course I teach I try to provide a variety of assessments catered specifically to students needs. In my Optimization course, students had to submit an Excel Workbook involving several modeling exercises instead of taking a final exam. For Discrete Math, which was taught during Covid, we created a repository of new WeBWorK problems over the summer and replaced in-person exams with ones on WeBWorK and Zoom. Students also had to submit weekly short auto-graded assignments within the textbook which provided immediate feedback. For Algebraic Topology course, I replaced the final exam with an oral exam and a written report as I was more interested in testing students ability to approach a challenging problem than actually getting a rigorous proof in a short amount of time. Course Design I continually update my courses as every cohort of students is unique. I try to imagine the course from students perspective and adapt it to their level of mathematical maturity while being vigilant of the expert blind spot. It is very important for me that my course is meaningful and intellectually fulfilling to students. I completely restructured my Optimization course to make applications and modeling an essential component. I wrote my own set of notes using RMarkdown as I did not find books with the right mix of theory and applications. I have designed and taught a fully flipped Honors Single Variable Calculus course at JHU. At Canada/USA Mathcamp, I had to develop and teach a short five-day class every week for five weeks while being involved with other camp activities; I could not have asked for better training grounds for course design. Classroom Environment I make great efforts to ensure that a course syllabus is welcoming and encouraging, being the first document that students see. While teaching online during Covid, my priority was to alleviate student anxiety and ensuring that students were not disadvantaged because of lack of face-to-face meetings and technical difficulties. After each (autograded) exam, I went through all student responses to reassign any points lost due to minor typos and system errors. I also maintained an active discussion forum on Piazza to foster a sense of community. I have taught huge coordinated courses where I was the sole point of contact for over 150 students. This challenging experience taught me how to be more inclusive and considerate of students from very diverse backgrounds and to ensure that even those who had other priorities could benefit from learning math in whatever way possible. I strive to get my students comfortable with the messy process of discovery in math. My classes are fun, interactive, and often times flipped. I greatly value one-to-one interactions as these allow students to get to know me as an individual. It is important for me and valuable for students to see me struggle and make mistakes. I hold a lot of office hours in a collaborative space that encourages group work. My office hours always have a high attendance. I memorize all of my students names so that I can connect with them on a personal level. Professional Development I try to keep myself updated on the advances in pedagogical techniques and find it valuable to hear about other educators teaching experiences. I am a member of the Project NExT20 cohort, a professional development program sponsored by the MAA for math educators at the university level. I have completed a certification course at the Teaching Academy at JHU where I learned about several important pedagogical concepts such as inquiry-based learning, backward course design, learning objectives, etc. which I regularly incorporate into my own teaching. I regularly attend the workshops and seminars organized at the Center for Teaching and Learning at both UWO and NU and most recently Open Math Workshops and SIGMAA IBL workshops by MAA. In addition to providing me new information and skills, these workshops also allow me to take on the role of a student and stay grounded. Mentorship I find it fulfilling to mentor students outside of the regular classroom setting. I am currently a supplementary instructor for the Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program, a yearlong experience in mathematics that seeks to increase the number of graduate students in the mathematical sciences from historically underrepresented groups. I am also a co-organizer of the Northwestern Emerging Scholars Program, which is similar to math circles for first-year students. I have organized and participated in a Directed Reading Program that pairs undergraduate students with graduate students/junior faculty to undertake independent study projects as a mentor and a co-organizer. I started a DRP chapter at UWO here with the help of one of my colleagues. My biggest influences have come from being a mentor (2017-20) and an academic coordinator (2018) at the Canada/USA Mathcamp, a summer program for high school students. Mathcamp gave me an opportunity to be a part of a loving and caring community, to be surrounded by people who love math and love to teach it and excel at it. I took on the role of an academic coordinator to contribute back to Mathcamp, to challenge myself, and to learn more about teaching. The academic coordinators are responsible for designing and running all the academic activities, including, inviting and hosting external visitors, designing a balanced five-week class schedule (nearly 60 classes), assigning (110) students to projects, and teaching. Future Goals My next big goal is to figure out ways to quantitatively assess my teaching and pedagogical effectiveness. I wish to teach more interdisciplinary courses that involve student projects and real world applications. In the winter quarter, I intend to use SIMIODE textbook, which takes a modeling first approach, for teaching differential equations. I am currently contributing to Open Education Resources and wish to expand these projects in the future with focus on book publishing and online assessments as these resources are bound to play a central role in successfully adapting courses to an online setting.

The course was aimed at upper level undergraduates majoring in math and economics and covered the topics of linear programming, simplex method, duality theory, and KKT conditions along with applications. The class had on average 12, mostly final-year, students. Class Notes: Most textbooks I encountered were either too theoretical or too applied. I did not find a textbookt that was a good fit for this course. As such, I wrote detailed notes for this course in RMarkdown which can be found here: apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization. Excel Worksheets: I designed the course to have both a theoretical and a practical component. The lectures focused on the theory of optimization and the discussion sections focused on applications. Students had to model and solve optimization problems during the weekly discussion sections using the Solver tool in Excel. These were to be submitted at the end of the quarter and formed a significant assessment component. 2.2 Algebraic Topology University of Western Ontario, Winter 2021 In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology for graduate students and upper-level undergrads. This was a small class with 6 graduate and 6 undergraduate students. The main textbook for the course was Hatcher. The course covered topics such as the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology. This was a fully online course delivered over Zoom. I used GoodNotes for course delivery. I replaced the final exam with an oral exam and a written report as I was more interested in testing students ability to approach a challenging problem than actually getting a rigorous proof in a short amount of time. The course relied heavily on solving challenging homework problem sheets, which I paid meticulous attention to develop. The problem sheets for this course can be found here: problem sets. 2.3 Discrete Structures for Engineering University of Western Ontario, Fall 2021 This was a semester long four-credit course offered to second-year software engineering students. Students were introduced to fundamental concepts in discrete math, such as logic, combinatorics, modular arithmetic as well as proof-writing. I was the only instructor for this course. My class had nearly 200 students. I had to adapt the course to fit an online mode of delivery. This has been most challenging teaching project so far as over the summer I had to adapt a regular course to an online asynchronous setting. While I was preparing for the course, my priority was to reduce student anxiety, simplify the course delivery as much as possible, and minimize the screen time for students. Textbook: I decided to abandon the traditional textbooks and chose an online one, called Zybooks, which had interactive components and provided students with immediate feedback. The book is also extremely comprehensive and contains copious amounts of auto-graded exercises, in addition to several practice problems, which I assigned weekly to help keep students on track. Finally, the book is exceptionally configurable, both in terms of content and structure. The textbook can be found here: Video Lectures: To minimize the amount of required screen-time for students I made short videos for each topic instead of a long one for each lecture. Having a textbook that I knew would fill in the gaps left out by the short lectures was crucial for making this choice. I embedded these video lectures directly within the textbook to provide a centralized resource to students, much like other online platforms such as Coursera and Kaggle. The video lectures are also available on YouTube at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN Exam: I decided to use WeBWorK to make exam problems. I chose WeBWork because it is robust and reliable, and it allows for both internal randomization within a question and randomization between questions. With my postdoc advisor and two students help, we designed a repository of several hundred problems for discrete math on WeBWork. Having an extensive repository of questions enabled me to create unique exams for every student. This repository is easily portable and can be adapted to any discrete math course. Rubric for proofs: This course introduced students to proof-writing in addition to logic and combinatorics. This was especially challenging to teach in an online asynchronous setting as it is not possible to provide students with immediate feedback. To remedy this, I decided to grade students on only the writing part of proofs. I designed the homework questions based on the textbook questions (for which detailed solutions were provided) and provided students with a rubric on which their writing was going to be graded. Discussion forums: I realized early on that communication was going to be the key to this courses smooth running. For this reason, I choose Piazza as a discussion forum to answer student questions and encourage them to answer each others problems. Piazza is very intuitive, easily searchable, and allows for anonymous posts. A demo of the discussion forum can be found here: https://piazza.com/demo_login?nid=kd1rr8nxc6z4b5&amp;auth=f76e59e 2.4 Honors Single Variable Calculus Johns Hopkins University, Fall 2017, 2018 At JHU, I got an opportunity to develop and teach Honors Single Variable Calculus for two semesters. This is an experimental full semester four-credit course offered at JHU to first-year undergraduates. The course covers all of the first-year calculus and introduces students to proof writing. This is the first course I had to design from scratch. In the previous years, the course was mostly taught in a lecture format. I decided to transition to a fully inquiry-based format. For this, I took the suggested textbook for this course and converted it into weekly guided exercises. Because the classes were small, I often dynamically modified the course material to suit the class. Designing this course gave me insights into the process of student learning and helped me combat expert blind spot. The materials for this course can be found here: https://apurvanakade.github.io/for-students.html#honors-single-variable-calculus 2.5 Intersession Courses Johns Hopkins University, Winter 2017, 2018 I taught two week-long intersession courses titled Hitchhikers Guide to Algebraic Topology and Symmetries &amp; Polynomials. I taught both of these courses in a flipped classroom format. I assigned students guided exercises, which they solved to learn more about the subject. What was both challenging and fun was that the students were not math majors; I had to remove all the mathematical jargon and could not even expect them to know how to write proofs. I had to design my course around concrete examples and find easily accessible concepts. For Hitchhikers Guide to Algebraic Topology, I asked the students to read and present applications of algebraic topology to other fields of science of their choosing. We had several exciting conversations about things like applications of knot theory to protein folding and data science. The notes and the student presentations can be found here: apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017 h2g2 alg top/index.html 2.6 Canada/USA Mathcamp I taught at an intensive, residential, five-week summer camp for mathematically talented high school kids for five summers. The academic day at the camp is filled with classes, talks, and office hours with more than 100 courses offered each summer, covering material typically only encountered in college or grad school. My non-teaching duties included living in the dorms with students as an RA, being an academic advisor, and advising students on which courses to take. More information can be found here: https://www.mathcamp.org/jobs/grad_students/ Mentor: I designed and taught week-long courses on advanced mathematical topics such as linear algebra, manifolds, Riemann surfaces, representation theory, computer-assisted theorem proving, and mentored several reading and coding projects. A defining feature of Mathcamp is that each student designs their own schedule (with the guidance of an academic advisor). As such, the courses need to be designed to be both interesting and challenging. This year I had the added challenge of doing this online. For this, I decided to create a hybrid coding/math course that introduced students to computer-assisted theorem proving. For my more traditional courses, I taught using Jamboard, which allowed students to scroll through the previous pages.

For the first time, I feel like I will carry the material I learned in class for years and years, as its so applicative to real world problems. Optimization is a really useful and practical math course that all math majors should take. It isnt very proof-heavy and focuses more on computation. Apurva is phenomenal! He broke down key concepts with ease, and homework questions went over a variety of different examples. Optimization is interesting as a whole due to it wide applicability in other fields, but I felt this was an enjoyable course because of Apurva Dr. Nakade is the best teacher for second-year software engineering. Your recorded lectures are very clear and make me happy as I actually understand after watching them. You seem like a very hard-working professor that truly cares about their students. Thank you! The zybook and PA and CA are just perfect for making me on-track. Im never behind in this class because of the PA and CA. The PAs and CAs are helpful and fun and an interactive way that helps me learn the concepts better. I like that I am not punished for when I get an answer incorrect and am instead presented with the solution so I can better understand it while learning. The webworks assessments are also a good and fair evaluation of my understanding (Also, thank you for not using Proctortrack because the idea of it really stresses me out.) The use of ZyBooks to teach discrete math was an absolute genius move, as the online textbook paired with the instructor videos were extremely clear in explaining and testing knowledge of mathematical concepts. I recommend using it for future years Apurva is the best Professor. Though his lecture notes can have minor mistakes, he is a very nice guy and you can ask him questions without being intimidated. His office hours are very helpful and talking to him about nonmath things are also a lot of fun. Professor Nakade is so kind and enthusiastic about helping his students learn. This quarter of MENU was definitely challenging (like the other two), but there is a strong system of support from office hours and studying with MENU friends that makes the course doable. Apurva is very encouraging when you are struggling with a problem and you can really tell that he was excited about math and teaching! He is really passionate about the subject and explains things well. He is very funny and approachable in class, and he gives a lot of opportunities for students to ``check their understanding by participating in class, working through problems as a class, etc. He also would always stay after class for questions if anyone had any. 6.2 Peer Evaluations In Winter 2020, I participated in the Teaching Mentor Program at UWO. The Teaching Mentor Program is a cohort-based hands-on learning experience, wherein participants work with a group of 4-5 interdisciplinary graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to observe and offer feedback on one anothers teaching. Groups will meet multiple times over the course of the semester, to act as students in one anothers teaching demonstrations. My group had four participants whose feedbacks are attached here.
