\chapter*{Introduction}\label{introduction}}


I am a postdoctoral lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at Northwestern
University. I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Western
Ontario from 2019 to 2021. I obtained my Ph.D.~from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled \emph{An application of
the h-principle to Manifold Calculus}.

My academic responsibilities have included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  coordinating and teaching multi-section courses,
\item
  teaching in-person and online courses with several hundred students,
\item
  adapting large service courses for asynchronous education,
\item
  creating advanced electives and short boot camp courses for small groups of students,
\item
  managing TAs,
\item
  hiring mentors for summer camps,
\item
  supervising reading courses and reading programs,
\item
  creating open education resources such as video lectures and Webwork questions,
\item
  creating course content using RMarkdown and PreTeXt,
\item
  formalizing mathematics in Lean theorem prover.
\end{itemize}

I have taught topics spanning calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, linear programming, discrete math, math formalization, manifolds, and algebraic topology.
In recent years, my focus has been on creating course content that is reusable, adaptable, and freely available.
I'm interested in creating and redesigning interdisciplinary math courses focusing on real-world applications and modeling.

\hypertarget{teaching-statement}{%
\chapter{Teaching Statement}\label{teaching-statement}}

\hypertarget{teaching-philosophy}{%
\subsubsection*{Teaching Philosophy}\label{teaching-philosophy}}


I believe the best way to learn math is by making mistakes, getting confused, and struggling toward a solution. I consider myself a coach and a facilitator. I teach with the core philosophy that my primary goal is to provide my students with a welcoming and inclusive environment where experimentation is encouraged, and honest mistakes aren't penalized. I incorporate active learning in all my classes. A math classroom is a place for students, and even the instructor, to grow as mathematicians.

\hypertarget{use-of-technology}{%
\subsubsection*{Use of Technology}\label{use-of-technology}}


Students retain their knowledge better when they engage with a subject through multiple modalities. Technological tools are perfect for accomplishing this.
I created weekly Excel worksheets for modeling linear programming scenarios for teaching linear programming. For Discrete Math, I used an online textbook with (mandatory) interactive activities scattered throughout the text and made YouTube videos for each section embedded directly in the book. Student responses to these have been overwhelmingly positive.
I intend to use modeling resources provided by SIMIODE\footnote{Systemic Initiative for Modeling Investigations \& Opportunities with Differential Equations, \url{https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/simiode}} to teach Differential equations.

I strongly believe in making education more accessible by creating open educational resources (OER).
We now have the technology to accomplish this.
I have co-received an OER Faculty Grant for adding WeBWorK exercises to my colleagues' \href{http://linear-algebra.northwestern.pub/frontmatter-1.html}{Linear Algebra OER textbook} written in \href{https://pretextbook.org/}{PreTeXt}. I also intend to turn my \href{https://apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization/}{Optimization course notes} into an OER textbook.

\hypertarget{diversifying-assessments}{%
\subsubsection*{Diversifying Assessments}\label{diversifying-assessments}}


Students often perform poorly on exams not because of a lack of understanding but because of exam anxiety and a lack of exam-taking skills. Traditional exams do not faithfully represent the challenges students are likely to face in real life either. As such, in every course I teach, I provide a variety of assessments explicitly catered to students' needs. In my Optimization course, students had to submit an Excel Workbook involving several modeling exercises instead of taking a final exam.
For Discrete Math, taught during Covid, we created a repository of new WeBWorK problems over the summer and replaced in-person exams with WeBWorK and Zoom.
Students also had to submit weekly short auto-graded assignments within the textbook, which provided immediate feedback. I also made a \protect\hyperlink{rubric-for-grading-proofs}{detailed rubric} focused on evaluating the quality of proof-writing. For the Algebraic Topology course, I replaced the final exam with an oral and a written report as I was more interested in testing students' ability to approach a challenging problem than coming up with rigorous proofs under time pressure.
In my current honors linear algebra course, I'm giving students short weekly quizzes during discussion sections with no time limits to ease them into the university exam system.

\hypertarget{course-design}{%
\subsubsection*{Course Design}\label{course-design}}


When (re)designing a course, I try to imagine the class from a student's perspective and adapt it to their level of mathematical maturity while being vigilant of the expert blind spot. It is essential for me that my course is meaningful and intellectually fulfilling to students. I completely restructured my Optimization course to make applications and modeling a critical component. I created detailed \href{https://apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization/}{notes} using RMarkdown as I did not find books with the right mix of theory and applications. I have designed and taught an entirely flipped Honors Single Variable Calculus course at JHU. I learned a lot about how to get students engaged in a classroom from this experience.
At Canada/USA Mathcamp, I had to develop and teach a five-day undergraduate math class every week for five weeks while being involved with other camp activities.
I could not have asked for better training grounds for course design.
Notes for many of these classes are available on \href{https://apurvanakade.github.io/math-notes.html}{my website}.

\hypertarget{classroom-environment}{%
\subsubsection*{Classroom Environment}\label{classroom-environment}}


I strive to get my students comfortable with the messy process of discovery in math.
My classes are fun, interactive, and often flipped.
I memorize all my students' names to connect with them.
In every class, I require students to solve problems and roam around to check on their work.
I hold many office hours in a collaborative space that encourages group work. My office hours always have high attendance and tend to turn into group study sessions.
They allow me to observe how students approach problem-solving, enabling me to provide them with pointed feedback.

I make great efforts to ensure that a course syllabus is welcoming and encouraging, being the first document that students see. While teaching online during Covid, my priority was to alleviate student anxiety and ensure students were not disadvantaged because of the lack of face-to-face meetings and technical difficulties. After each (auto-graded) WeBWorK exam, I reviewed all student responses to reassign any points lost due to minor typos and system errors. I also maintained an active discussion forum on Piazza to foster a sense of community. I have taught coordinated courses where I was the sole point of contact for over 150 students. This challenging experience taught me how to be more inclusive and considerate of students from very diverse backgrounds and ensure that even those with other priorities can benefit from learning math in whatever way possible.

\hypertarget{professional-development}{%
\subsubsection*{Professional Development}\label{professional-development}}


I keep myself updated on the advances in pedagogical techniques and find it valuable to hear about other educators' experiences. I am a member of the Project NExT'20\footnote{A professional development program sponsored by the MAA for math educators at the university level, \url{https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next}} cohort. I have completed a certification course at the \href{https://ctei.jhu.edu/teaching-academy}{Teaching Academy at JHU}, where I learned about several pedagogical concepts, such as inquiry-based learning, backward course design, and learning objectives, which I regularly incorporate into my teaching. I have regularly attended workshops and seminars organized at the Center for Teaching and Learning at UWO and NU and, most recently, \href{https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/open-math}{MAA Open Math Workshops}, SIGMAA IBL workshops\footnote{Special Interest Group of the Mathematical Association of America, \url{http://sigmaa.maa.org/ibl/}}, and \href{https://olsume.org/}{Online Seminar On Undergraduate Mathematics Education}.
In addition to providing me with new information and skills, these workshops also allow me to take on the role of a student and stay an active learner.

\hypertarget{mentoring}{%
\subsubsection*{Mentoring}\label{mentoring}}


I find it fulfilling to mentor students outside of the regular classroom setting.
I am currently a supplementary instructor for the Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program, a yearlong experience in mathematics that seeks to increase the number of graduate students in the mathematical sciences from historically underrepresented groups. I have organized and participated in a Directed Reading Program that pairs undergraduate students with graduate students/junior faculty to undertake independent study projects as a mentor and a co-organizer. I started a DRP chapter at UWO with the help of one of my colleagues. At JHU, I held review/problem-solving sessions for graduate students to prep them for their algebra prelims.

My biggest influences have come from being a mentor (2017-20) and an academic coordinator (2018) at the Canada/USA Mathcamp, a summer program for high school students. Mathcamp allowed me to be a part of a loving and caring community, surrounded by people who love math and love to teach and excel at it. I took on the role of an academic coordinator to contribute back to Mathcamp, challenge myself, and learn more about teaching. The academic coordinators are responsible for designing and running all the educational activities, including inviting and hosting external visitors, planning a balanced five-week class schedule (nearly 60 classes), assigning (110) students to projects, and teaching.

\hypertarget{future-goals}{%
\subsubsection*{Future Goals}\label{future-goals}}


In the future, I want to design and teach more interdisciplinary courses that involve student projects and real-world applications.
I am also interested in making existing math courses more applied, especially courses aimed at non-math majors.
I want to incorporate active learning in coordinated courses without putting undue pressure on individual instructors.
This is particularly challenging as most instructors are primarily researchers and often have limited time to dedicate to teaching.
The solution is to develop structured resources (like online asynchronous assessments, modeling first textbooks, programming assignments in SageMath, and IBL scripts) to enable instructors to incorporate active learning in their classrooms at no extra cost.
Finally, I am currently contributing to Open Education Resources. I want to expand these projects in the future with a focus on online assessments, as this is the main bottleneck in successfully adapting courses to an online setting.

\hypertarget{introduction-to-optimization}{%
\section{Introduction to Optimization}\label{introduction-to-optimization}}

\emph{Northwestern University, Fall and Winter 2021}

I taught this quarter-long course for two quarters in the Winter and Spring of 2021.
The course was aimed at upper-level undergraduates majoring in math and economics.
It covered the topics of linear programming, the simplex method, duality theory, KKT conditions, and applications.
The class had, on average, 12, mostly final-year students.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Class Notes:}
  Most textbooks I encountered were either too theoretical or too applied.
  I failed to find one that was a good fit for this course.
  As such, I wrote detailed notes for this course in RMarkdown which can be found here: \href{https://apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization/}{apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization}.
\item
  \textbf{Excel Worksheets:}
  I designed the course to have both a theoretical and a practical component.
  The lectures focused on optimization theory, and the discussion sections on applications.
  Students had to model and solve optimization problems during the weekly discussion sections using the \href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-solver-add-in-in-excel-612926fc-d53b-46b4-872c-e24772f078ca}{Solver tool in Excel}.
  These were to be submitted at the end of the quarter and formed a significant assessment component.
  A sample worksheet can be found in the \protect\hyperlink{sample-worksheet}{Appendix}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{menu-linear-algebra-and-multivariable-calculus}{%
\section{MENU Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus}\label{menu-linear-algebra-and-multivariable-calculus}}

\emph{Northwestern University, 2021-22 (instructor), 2022-23 (coordinator)}

This is a year-long accelerated course covering the topics of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. I was an instructor for this course in 2021-22 and am currently (2022-23) the course coordinator. The class has nearly a hundred first-year and second-year students divided into three sections at the start of the year.

I noticed during my first year that students were extremely stressed in this course and we saw significant attrition.
I believe that this is because the syllabus is not updated to the realities of a post-Covid world where students are on average less prepared and less mathematically mature.
Many students in our class had not taken an in-person exam in over a year and had a skewed perception of their own preparedness.

As an instructor, I tried to support my students by providing a large number of office hours.
This year, as a coordinator, I have substantially simplified the course structure to allow students time to catch up.
I've shortened the exams by diversifying the types of questions.
During the discussion sections, students take quizzes with flexible end times; the idea being to give them an opportunity to self-assess without making it feel like a test.
I regularly encourage students to work in groups and have provided several resources to help them with mathematical writing, time management, and becoming better learners.
I continue to offer a lot of office hours, which still see substantial student attendance.

\hypertarget{algebraic-topology}{%
\section{Algebraic Topology}\label{algebraic-topology}}

\emph{University of Western Ontario, Winter 2021}

In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology for graduate students and upper-level undergrads. This was a small class with six graduate and six undergraduate students. The primary textbook for the course was Hatcher. The course covered topics such as the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology. This was a fully online course delivered over Zoom. I used GoodNotes for course delivery. I replaced the final exam with an oral and a written report as I was more interested in testing students' ability to approach a challenging problem than coming up with a rigorous proof under time pressure. The course relied heavily on solving conceptual homework problem sheets, which I paid meticulous attention to developing.
The problem sheets for this course can be found here: \href{https://github.com/apurvnakade/uwo2021-algebraic-topology/tree/main/output}{problem sets}.

\hypertarget{discrete-structures-for-engineering}{%
\section{Discrete Structures for Engineering}\label{discrete-structures-for-engineering}}

\emph{University of Western Ontario, Fall 2020}

This was a semester-long four-credit course offered to second-year software engineering students. Students were introduced to fundamental concepts in discrete math, such as logic, combinatorics, modular arithmetic, and proof-writing. I was the only instructor for this course. My class had nearly 200 students. I had to adapt the course to fit an online mode of delivery.

This has been the most challenging teaching project so far, as, over the summer, I had to adapt a regular course to an online asynchronous setting. While preparing for the course, my priority was to reduce student anxiety, simplify the course delivery as much as possible, and minimize the screen time for students.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Textbook:}

  I abandoned the traditional textbooks and chose an online one called \href{https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020}{Zybooks}, which had interactive components and provided students with immediate feedback. The book is also highly comprehensive and contains copious amounts of auto-graded exercises and several practice problems, which I assigned weekly to help keep students on track. Finally, the book is exceptionally configurable in terms of content and structure. The textbook can be found here:
  \href{https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020}{learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020}
\item
  \textbf{Video Lectures:}

  To minimize the required screen time for students, I made short videos for each topic instead of long ones for each lecture. Having a textbook that I knew would fill in the gaps left out by the short lectures was crucial for making this choice. I embedded these video lectures directly within the textbook to provide a centralized resource to students, much like other online platforms such as Coursera and Kaggle.
  The video lectures are also available on YouTube at the following link: \url{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN}
\item
  \textbf{Exam:}

  I decided to use \href{https://webwork.maa.org}{WeBWorK} to make exam problems.
  I chose WeBWork because it is robust and reliable and allows for internal randomizations within a question and randomization between questions. With my postdoc advisor and two students' help, we designed a repository of several hundred problems for discrete math on WeBWork. This repository is easily portable and adaptable to any discrete math course. An extensive repository of questions enabled me to create unique exams for every student.
\item
  \textbf{Rubric for proofs:}

  This course introduced students to proof-writing in addition to logic and combinatorics. Teaching this in an online asynchronous setting was incredibly challenging, as providing students with immediate feedback is impossible. To remedy this, I decided to grade students on only the \emph{writing} part of proofs.
  I designed the homework questions based on the textbook questions (for which the book provided detailed solutions) and gave students a rubric on which their writing would be graded. The rubric can be found in the \protect\hyperlink{rubric-for-grading-proofs}{Appendix}.
\item
  \textbf{Discussion forums:}

  I realized early on that communication would be the key to this course's smooth running.
  For this reason, I choose Piazza as a discussion forum to answer student questions and encourage them to answer each other's problems.
  Piazza is very intuitive, easily searchable, and allows for anonymous posts.
  Anonymized version of my class' discussion forum can be found here: \url{https://piazza.com/demo_login?nid=kd1rr8nxc6z4b5\&auth=f76e59e}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{honors-single-variable-calculus}{%
\section{Honors Single Variable Calculus}\label{honors-single-variable-calculus}}

\emph{Johns Hopkins University, Fall 2017, 2018}

At JHU, I got an opportunity to develop and teach Honors Single Variable Calculus for two semesters. This is an experimental full-semester four-credit course offered at JHU to first-year undergraduates. The course covers all first-year calculus and introduces students to proof writing.

This was the first course I had to design from scratch.
In the previous years, the course was mostly taught in a lecture format.
I decided to transition to a fully inquiry-based format.
For this, I took the suggested textbook for this course and converted it into weekly guided exercises.
Because the classes were small, I often dynamically modified the course material to suit the class.
Designing this course gave me insights into the process of student learning and I learned a lot about how to keep students engaged.
The materials for this course can be found here: \url{https://apurvanakade.github.io/for-students.html\#honors-single-variable-calculus}

\hypertarget{intersession-courses}{%
\section{Intersession Courses}\label{intersession-courses}}

\emph{Johns Hopkins University, Winter 2017, 2018}

I taught two week-long intersession courses, \emph{Hitchhiker's Guide to Algebraic Topology} and \emph{Symmetries \& Polynomials}. I taught both of these courses in a flipped classroom format. I assigned students guided exercises, which they solved to learn more about the subject. What was both challenging and fun was that the students were not math majors; I had to remove all the mathematical jargon and could not even expect them to know how to write proofs. I had to design my course around concrete examples and find easily accessible concepts.

For Hitchhiker's Guide to Algebraic Topology, I asked the students to read and present applications of algebraic topology to other fields of science of their choosing. We had several exciting conversations about the applications of knot theory to protein folding and data science. The notes and the student presentations can be found here: \url{https://apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017_h2g2_alg_top/index.html}

\hypertarget{canadausa-mathcamp}{%
\section{Canada/USA Mathcamp}\label{canadausa-mathcamp}}

I taught at an intensive, residential, five-week summer camp for mathematically talented high school
kids for five summers. The academic day at the camp is filled with classes, talks, and office hours with
more than 100 courses offered each summer, covering material typically only encountered in college or
grad school. My non-teaching duties included living in the dorms with students as an RA, being an
academic advisor, and advising students on which courses to take. More information can be found here:
\url{https://www.mathcamp.org/jobs/grad_students/}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mentor:}

  I designed and taught week-long courses on advanced mathematical topics such as linear algebra, manifolds, Riemann surfaces, representation theory, and computer-assisted theorem proving. I also mentored several reading and coding projects. A defining feature of Mathcamp is that each student designs their schedule (with the guidance of an academic advisor). As such, the courses need to be designed to be interesting and challenging. In 2020, I had the added challenge of doing this online. For this, I created a hybrid coding/math course introducing students to computer-assisted theorem proving.
  Notes from my Mathcamp classes can be found here: \url{https://apurvanakade.github.io/for-students.html\#canadausa}.
  Following is a list of some to the topics I taught:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lean at MC2020
  \item
    Crash course on linear algebra
  \item
    Galois correspondence of covering spaces
  \item
    From high school arithmetic to group cohomology
  \item
    Cohomology via sheaves
  \item
    How curved is a potato
  \item
    Would I ever lie group to you?
  \item
    Riemann surfaces
  \item
    All things manifoldy
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Academic Coordinator:}

  In the summer of 2017, I was one of the two academic coordinators at Mathcamp.
  The academic coordinators are responsible for designing and running all the educational activities, including inviting and hosting external visitors, preparing a balanced five-week class schedule (more than 100 classes), assigning (110) students to projects, teaching, and being a part of the hiring team.

I am a supplemental instructor for the \href{https://sites.northwestern.edu/causeway/}{Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program}
at Northwestern University for the 2022-23 academic year.
My duties include meeting with the participants weekly as a tutor, holding office hours, and liaising with course instructors to provide additional examples, exercises, and reviews for the students.

The Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program is a yearlong experience in mathematics that seeks to increase the number of graduate mathematical science graduates from historically underrepresented groups. Beginning in July 2021, Causeway participants will undertake a rigorous program of study in foundational coursework; work closely with Northwestern faculty on an appropriate research project, and receive career mentoring while serving as mentors for other groups themselves.

The Directed Reading Program pairs undergraduates with a graduate student/postdoc whose interests align with theirs and study a topic of their choice for one semester. It is intended to help motivated students explore topics more in-depth than possible in a classroom setting. I've helped start and organize the \href{https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/current_students/directed_reading_program.html}{DRP at UWO}. In the past, I have co-organized the \href{https://math.jhu.edu/drp.html}{DRP at JHU}.
These programs have been greatly successful at both the universities and have seen a steady increase in participants over the years.

\section{Project NExT}\label{project-next}}

Mathematical American Association's \href{https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next}{Project NExT (New Experiences in Teaching)} is a professional development program for new or recent Ph Ds in the mathematical sciences. It addresses all aspects of an academic career:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Improving the teaching and learning of mathematics
\item
  Engaging in research and scholarship
\item
  Finding exciting and interesting service opportunities
\item
  Participating in professional activities
\end{itemize}

This program provided me the opportunity to connect with and learn from other math educators from all over the country.

\hypertarget{jhu-teaching-academy-certification}{%
\section{JHU Teaching Academy Certification}\label{jhu-teaching-academy-certification}}

I have obtained a \href{https://ctei.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/coc}{teaching certification} from the
\href{https://ctei.jhu.edu/teaching-academy}{Teaching Academy at JHU}.
The Teaching Academy's Certificate of Completion program is designed to help prepare Ph.D.~students and Post-doctoral Fellows for academic careers and assist in acquiring a foundation for the teaching responsibilities associated with their first faculty appointments.
This program exposed me to teaching as a scholarship and got me started in my current career as a math educator.

\hypertarget{simiode-workshop}{%
\section{SIMIODE Workshop}\label{simiode-workshop}}

I attended a week-long MAA Open Math workshop in Summer 2022 about teaching differential equations using a modeling first approach.
This workshop was based on resources from \href{https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/simiode}{SIMIODE (Systemic Modelling Opportunities with Differential Equations)}. The workshop was highly relevant as I will be teaching this course in Winter 2023. I intend to redesign it to make it more applied and incorporate projects in assessments. I also plan to use the newly published \href{https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/simiode/textbook}{SIMIODE textbook} as the primary textbook.
The workshop was well-organized, and I learned a thing or two about how to run an excellent online program.

\hypertarget{sigmaa-ibl}{%
\section{SIGMAA IBL}\label{sigmaa-ibl}}

I have been attending \href{http://sigmaa.maa.org/ibl/}{SIGMAA IBL} (Special Interest Group of the Mathematical Association of America for Inquiry-Based Learning) workshops since joining Project NExT.
IBL SIGMAA aims to bring practitioners and others interested in IBL together to share teaching resources and experiences, encourage and publicize research related to IBL, and promote the proliferation of IBL in Mathematics through conversation and professional development.
I regularly attend their monthly talks about IBL teaching resources and experiences.
This quarter I've started regularly attending the \href{https://olsume.org/}{Online Seminar in Undergraduate Math Education} covering similar topics.

\hypertarget{critical-issues-in-math-education-workshop}{%
\section{Critical Issues in Math Education Workshop}\label{critical-issues-in-math-education-workshop}}

I attended the \href{https://www.msri.org/workshops/1028}{CIME workshop} at MSRI in Summer 2022.
The workshop brought together teachers and researchers from universities, community colleges, and K-12 schools. The goal was to explore the reasons for and processes by which change in university mathematics departments is initiated, promoted and sustained and lessons learned from change efforts in K-12.

\hypertarget{northwestern-excellence-in-teaching-alliance}{%
\section{Northwestern Excellence in Teaching Alliance}\label{northwestern-excellence-in-teaching-alliance}}

From 2021-22, I participated in Northwestern's teaching alliance program.
The program provided reading resources and guides through a Canvas course hosted by the Searle teaching center at Northwestern.
We met in small cohorts monthly to engage in conversations led by a faculty peer around teaching and learning.

\hypertarget{mastery-grading}{%
\section{Mastery Grading}\label{mastery-grading}}

In Summer 2019, I participated in a workshop on mastery grading.
During the workshop, we learned about standards-based grading, and we heard about how it has been implemented across a variety of courses.
I am considering implementing this grading system in the Intro to Proofs course I'm teaching in Winter 2023.

\hypertarget{science-of-learning-symposium-jhu}{%
\section{Science of Learning Symposium, JHU}\label{science-of-learning-symposium-jhu}}

I attended a biennial Science of Learning symposium at JHU from 2014-18.
The event brought together experts in cognitive science, neuroscience, education, and other fields to explore different perspectives on the cognitive and neural bases for learning and motivation.
I found the insights about the physiological basis of learning to be very helpful.
I have since read more about these topics and completed the ``Learning how to learn'' course on Coursera.

\subsection{Selected Student Feedback}\label{selected-student-feedback}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This{[}Optimization{]} was the best math class I've taken so far at Northwestern. For the first time, I feel like I will carry the material I learned in class
  for years and years, as it's so applicative to real world problems.
\item
  Optimization is a really useful and practical math course that all math majors should take. It isn't very proof-heavy and focuses
  more on computation.\\
\item
  Apurva is phenomenal! He broke down key concepts with ease, and homework questions went over a variety of different examples.
  Optimization is interesting as a whole due to it wide applicability in other fields, but I felt this was an enjoyable course because of
  Apurva
\item
  Dr.~Nakade is the best teacher for second-year software engineering. Your recorded lectures are very clear and make me happy as I
  actually understand after watching them. You seem like a very hard-working professor that truly cares about their students. Thank you!
  The zybook and PA and CA are just perfect for making me on-track. I'm never behind in this class because of the PA and CA.
\item
  The PAs and CAs are helpful and
  fun and an interactive way that helps me learn the concepts better. I like that I am not punished for when I get an answer incorrect and
  am instead presented with the solution so I can better understand it while learning. The webworks assessments are also a good and
  fair evaluation of my understanding
  (Also, thank you for not using Proctortrack because the idea of it really stresses me out.)
\item
  The use of ZyBooks to teach discrete math was an absolute genius move, as the online textbook paired with the instructor videos were
  extremely clear in explaining and testing knowledge of mathematical concepts. I recommend using it for future years
\item
  Apurva is the best Professor. Though his lecture notes can have minor mistakes, he is a very nice guy and you can ask him
  questions without being intimidated. His office hours are very helpful and talking to him about non--math things are also a lot of fun.
\item
  Professor Nakade is so kind and enthusiastic about helping his students learn. This quarter of MENU was definitely challenging
  (like the other two), but there is a strong system of support from office hours and studying with MENU friends that makes the course
  doable.
\item
  Apurva is very encouraging when you are struggling with a problem and you can really tell that he was excited about math and
  teaching!\\
\item
  He is really passionate about the subject and explains things well. He is very funny and approachable in class, and he gives a lot of
  opportunities for students to ``check their understanding'' by participating in class, working through problems as a class, etc. He
  also would always stay after class for questions if anyone had any.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{peer-evaluations}{%
\section{Peer Evaluations}\label{peer-evaluations}}

In Winter 2020, I participated in the Teaching Mentor Program at UWO.
The Teaching Mentor Program is a cohort-based hands-on learning experience, wherein participants
work with a group of 4-5 interdisciplinary graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to observe
and offer feedback on one another's teaching. Groups will meet multiple times over the course of
the semester, to act as students in one another's teaching demonstrations. My group had four
participants whose feedbacks are attached here.
