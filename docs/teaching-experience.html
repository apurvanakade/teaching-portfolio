<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction to Optimization<a href="teaching-experience.html#introduction-to-optimization" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>Northwestern University, Fall and Winter 2021</em></p>
<p>I taught this quarter long course for two quarters in Winter and Spring 2021. The course was aimed at upper level undergraduates majoring in math and economics and covered the topics of linear programming, simplex method, duality theory, and KKT conditions along with applications. The class had on average 12, mostly final-year, students.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Class Notes:</strong>
Most textbooks I encountered were either too theoretical or too applied. I did not find a textbookt that was a good fit for this course. As such, I wrote detailed notes for this course in RMarkdown which can be found here: <a href="https://apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization/">apurvanakade.github.io/Introduction-to-Optimization</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Excel Worksheets:</strong>
I designed the course to have both a theoretical and a practical component. The lectures focused on the theory of optimization and the discussion sections focused on applications. Students had to model and solve optimization problems during the weekly discussion sections using the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-solver-add-in-in-excel-612926fc-d53b-46b4-872c-e24772f078ca">Solver tool in Excel</a>. These were to be submitted at the end of the quarter and formed a significant assessment component.</p></li>

<!-- ## MENU Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus

This is a year-long accelerated course covering the topics in linear algebra and
multivariable calculus. I was an instructor for this course in 2021-22 and am currently (2022-23) the course coordinator. 

- **Discussion worksheets:**
  My primary focus as a coordinator is to reduce student stress without comprimising with the accelerated nature of the course. For this, I reduced the amount of material covered in lectures and created meaningful discussion worksheets to complement the lecture materials. The discussion worksheets also enables me to incorporate an active learning component in the course.  -->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Algebraic Topology<a href="teaching-experience.html#algebraic-topology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>University of Western Ontario, Winter 2021</em></p>
<p>In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology for graduate students and upper-level undergrads. This was a small class with 6 graduate and 6 undergraduate students. The main textbook for the course was Hatcher. The course covered topics such as the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology. This was a fully online course delivered over Zoom. I used GoodNotes for course delivery. I replaced the final exam with an oral exam and a written report as I was more interested in testing students’ ability to approach a challenging problem than actually getting a rigorous proof in a short amount of time. The course relied heavily on solving challenging homework problem sheets, which I paid meticulous attention to develop. The problem sheets for this course can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/apurvnakade/uwo2021-algebraic-topology/tree/main/output">problem sets</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Discrete Structures for Engineering<a href="teaching-experience.html#discrete-structures-for-engineering" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>University of Western Ontario, Fall 2021</em></p>
<p>This was a semester long four-credit course offered to second-year software engineering students. Students were introduced to fundamental concepts in discrete math, such as logic, combinatorics, modular arithmetic as well as proof-writing. I was the only instructor for this course. My class had nearly 200 students. I had to adapt the course to fit an online mode of delivery.</p>
<p>This has been most challenging teaching project so far as over the summer I had to adapt a regular course to an online asynchronous setting. While I was preparing for the course, my priority was to reduce student anxiety, simplify the course delivery as much as possible, and minimize the screen time for students.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Textbook:</strong></p>
<p>I decided to abandon the traditional textbooks and chose an online one, called <a href="https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UWOMath2151ANakadeFall2020">Zybooks</a>, which had interactive components and provided students with immediate feedback. The book is also extremely comprehensive and contains copious amounts of auto-graded exercises, in addition to several practice problems, which I assigned weekly to help keep students on track. Finally, the book is exceptionally configurable, both in terms of content and structure.
The textbook can be found here: </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video Lectures:</strong></p>
<p>To minimize the amount of required screen-time for students I made short videos for each topic instead of a long one for each lecture.
Having a textbook that I knew would fill in the gaps left out by the short lectures was crucial for making this choice.
I embedded these video lectures directly within the textbook to provide a centralized resource to students, much like other online platforms such as Coursera and Kaggle.
The video lectures are also available on YouTube at the following link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAOfwfSuiKm3cL-JftD9ndrjYi7fPcqN</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exam:</strong></p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://webwork.maa.org">WeBWorK</a> to make exam problems.
I chose WeBWork because it is robust and reliable, and it allows for both internal randomization within a question and randomization between questions.
With my postdoc advisor and two students’ help, we designed a repository of several hundred problems for discrete math on WeBWork.
Having an extensive repository of questions enabled me to create unique exams for every student.
This repository is easily portable and can be adapted to any discrete math course.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubric for proofs:</strong></p>
<p>This course introduced students to proof-writing in addition to logic and combinatorics.
This was especially challenging to teach in an online asynchronous setting as it is not possible to provide students with immediate feedback.
To remedy this, I decided to grade students on only the <em>writing</em> part of proofs.
I designed the homework questions based on the textbook questions (for which detailed solutions were provided) and provided students with a rubric on which their writing was going to be graded.
<!-- The rubric can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:sample-teaching-materials}. --></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion forums:</strong></p>
<p>I realized early on that communication was going to be the key to this course’s smooth running.
For this reason, I choose Piazza as a discussion forum to answer student questions and encourage them to answer each other’s problems.
Piazza is very intuitive, easily searchable, and allows for anonymous posts.
A demo of the discussion forum can be found here: <a href="https://piazza.com/demo_login?nid=kd1rr8nxc6z4b5&amp;auth=f76e59e" class="uri">https://piazza.com/demo_login?nid=kd1rr8nxc6z4b5&amp;auth=f76e59e</a></p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Honors Single Variable Calculus<a href="teaching-experience.html#honors-single-variable-calculus" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>Johns Hopkins University, Fall 2017, 2018</em></p>
<p>At JHU, I got an opportunity to develop and teach Honors Single Variable Calculus for two semesters.
This is an experimental full semester four-credit course offered at JHU to first-year undergraduates.
The course covers all of the first-year calculus and introduces students to proof writing.</p>
<p>This is the first course I had to design from scratch.
In the previous years, the course was mostly taught in a lecture format.
I decided to transition to a fully inquiry-based format.
For this, I took the suggested textbook for this course and converted it into weekly guided exercises.
Because the classes were small, I often dynamically modified the course material to suit the class.
Designing this course gave me insights into the process of student learning and helped me combat expert blind spot.
The materials for this course can be found here: <a href="https://apurvanakade.github.io/for-students.html#honors-single-variable-calculus" class="uri">https://apurvanakade.github.io/for-students.html#honors-single-variable-calculus</a></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Intersession Courses<a href="teaching-experience.html#intersession-courses" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><em>Johns Hopkins University, Winter 2017, 2018</em></p>
<p>I taught two week-long intersession courses titled Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology and Symmetries &amp; Polynomials.
I taught both of these courses in a flipped classroom format.
I assigned students guided exercises, which they solved to learn more about the subject.
What was both challenging and fun was that the students were not math majors; I had to remove all the mathematical jargon and could not even
expect them to know how to write proofs.
I had to design my course around concrete examples and find easily accessible concepts.</p>
<p>For Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algebraic Topology, I asked the students to read and present applications of algebraic topology to other fields of science of their choosing.
We had several exciting conversations about things like applications of knot theory to protein folding and data science. The notes and the student presentations can be found here: apurvanakade.github.io/courses/2017 h2g2 alg top/index.html</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Canada/USA Mathcamp<a href="teaching-experience.html#canadausa-mathcamp" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I taught at an intensive, residential, five-week summer camp for mathematically talented high school
kids for five summers. The academic day at the camp is filled with classes, talks, and office hours with
more than 100 courses offered each summer, covering material typically only encountered in college or
grad school. My non-teaching duties included living in the dorms with students as an RA, being an
academic advisor, and advising students on which courses to take. More information can be found here:
<a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/jobs/grad_students/" class="uri">https://www.mathcamp.org/jobs/grad_students/</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mentor:</strong></p>
<p>I designed and taught week-long courses on advanced mathematical topics such as linear
algebra, manifolds, Riemann surfaces, representation theory, computer-assisted theorem proving, and
mentored several reading and coding projects. A defining feature of Mathcamp is that each student
designs their own schedule (with the guidance of an academic advisor). As such, the courses need to
be designed to be both interesting and challenging.
This year I had the added challenge of doing this online. For this, I decided to create a hybrid
coding/math course that introduced students to computer-assisted theorem proving. For my more
traditional courses, I taught using Jamboard, which allowed students to scroll through the previous
pages. Notes from my Mathcamp classes can be found here: <a href="https://apurvanakade.github.io/" class="uri">https://apurvanakade.github.io/</a>
