# Introduction {.unnumbered}

**This website is under construction and should be up-to-date by the end of September.**

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Northwestern
University. Before coming to Northwestern, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Western 
Ontario from 2019 to 2021. I obtained my PhD from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled An application of
the h-principle to Manifold Calculus.

My academic responsibilities have included  

- coordinating and teaching multi-section courses
- managing TAs 
- creating content for OER texts  
- to adapting large service courses for asynchronous education.  
- to managing and teaching in-person courses with several hundred students, 
- creating advanced electives and short bootcamp courses for small groups of students, 
<!-- FIXME: Clean this list of responsibilities. -->

I have taught topics spanning calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, proof checking using computers, manifolds, and topology.
<!-- FIXME: Update list of courses. -->

My current focus has been on finding ways of incorporating technology into my classes and make the
classes more relevant useful to students interested in applied fields.
