# Introduction {.unnumbered}

I'm a postdoctoral lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at Northwestern
University. I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Western
Ontario from 2019 to 2021. I obtained my Ph.D. from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled _An application of
the h-principle to Manifold Calculus_.

My academic responsibilities have included:

- coordinating and teaching multi-section courses
- teaching in-person and online courses with several hundred students,
- adapting large service courses for asynchronous education,
- creating advanced electives and short boot camp courses for small groups of students,
- managing TAs,
- hiring mentors for summer camps,
- supervising reading courses and reading programs,
- creating open education resources such as Webwork questions, 
- creating polished course notes using RMarkdown,
- formalizing mathematics in Lean theorem prover.

I have taught topics spanning calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, linear programming, discrete math, math formalization, manifolds, and algebraic topology.
My current focus is on incorporating technology into my courses, creating course resources that can be used asynchronously by students thereby providing additional support to instructors outside of classroom, and making courses more useful to students interested in applied fields.
