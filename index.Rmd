# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at Northwestern
University. Before Northwestern, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Western
Ontario from 2019 to 2021. I obtained my PhD from JHU in 2019 with a thesis titled _An application of
the h-principle to Manifold Calculus_.

My academic responsibilities have included

- coordinating and teaching multi-section courses
- managing and teaching in-person courses with several hundred students,
- adapting large service courses for asynchronous education,
- creating advanced electives and short bootcamp courses for small groups of students,
- creating content for OER texts,
- managing TAs,
- hiring mentors for summer camps,
- supervising reading courses and reading programs,
- formalizing mathematics in Lean theorem prover.

I have taught topics spanning calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, linear programming, discrete math, proof checking using computers, manifolds, and algebraic topology.
I'm currently focused on finding ways of incorporating technology into my courses and making the classes more useful to students interested in applied fields.
