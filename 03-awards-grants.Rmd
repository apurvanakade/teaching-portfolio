## Open Educational Resources Faculty Grant, NU 2022

I received a $10K Open Educational Resources Faculty Grant, joint with Aaron Greicius, at Northwestern University.
The grant is for adding interactive WeBWorK, and SageMath exercises to Aaron's open-source Linear Algebra textbook available here: http://linear-algebra.northwestern.pub/frontmatter-1.html
We hope to make the book self-contained and a complete replacement for a standard linear algebra text.
